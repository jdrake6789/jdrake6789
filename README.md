<p>Thank you for coming to my page!</p>
<h1>My name is Josh Drake and I'm the owner of JP Drake Web Services, LLC.</h1>

<p>My company focuses on high-end, technical optimization that stands above our competitors. Offerings include high-end optimization of websites, technical SEO using statistical analysis, and online marketing and promotion services known to excel the user traffic of any organization.</p>
<p>I approach web design and development using a stringent project management approach. I use knowledge and skills learned as an Engineering Project Manager for the Army and the Air Force to bring a detail-oriented perspective to every detail of my services.</p>
<p>Long before I reached my current station in life, I served as an Army Infantryman in the 10th Mountain Division, Fort Drum, NY. It was cold and tough and I learned that there are many things that I, and many others, could do when there were no other options.</p>
<p>In the infantry, a soldier learns to live very differently than other career selections. This meant low crawling through sand until I was bleeding from abrasion. It meant pushing myself until I thought I couldn't any more, than being pushed further, only to find that I had much more to give than I thought.</p>
<p>My time in the Army forged my path in life. It determined my approach to every situation, and made me tough as hell and quick to react.</p>


<h2>After the Army</h2>
<p>Before I moved into web development and design, I was a mechanical engineer. I earned my Master's of Science in Mechanical Engineering in 2014.</p>
<p>At the same time that I earned my degree, I also worked in commercial video production and marketing, including media-buying and distribution. I've written commercial scripts, ad and marketing copy, blog articles, technical and creative, and more.</p>
<p>After college, I worked for 7-months at the Grand-Coulee Dam, located in the geographical center of Washington State. Walking in with a master's degree meant I qualified for higher level positions and I was put in charge of the Right Powerhouse of the dam.</p>
<p>During my time as the Powerhouse Mechanical Engineer, I was able to streamline several processes that had been pushed aside for the lack of sufficient staff. The methods I used and changes that I made actually improved the operations of the dam.</p>
<p>I transitioned from the Grand Coulee Dam position to a two-year Army intership program in Mechanical Engineering and Construction Project Management. Overall, I worked for the Army and the Air Force managing, reviewing, designing, and standardizing multiple military construction projects.</p>

<h2>What I do and Why Businesses and Organizations Need My Skills</h2>
<p>My life experiences have provided me with a great deal of knowledge and a variety of skills.</p>
<p>Engineering taught me that I'm smarter than I thought. I can process complex mathematical and real-world problems in a systematic way. This makes me capable of approaching any problem that I face with anunderstanding of problem-solving, taking action, and ensuring a positive outcome.</p>
<p>Since 2012, I have studied and worked in web design, content creation, and traditional Search Engine Optimization. At first it was a way to earn extra money through college and my early career. But the combination of creative process and technical application quickly captured my interest.</p>
<p>I studied the trade of internet services. Not just marketing, but full-stack web design and development. I applied my writing skills to producing several blog articles, website content, and more.</p>
<p>For almost a decade, I have honed my abilities as a developer, a programmer, and a marketer. I studied, and still study, the advancements of search engine technologies, and have learned how to keep my fingers on the pulse of the web.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I learned how do things exactly right in a way that meets the demands of search algorithms. This knowledge makes me a subject-matter-expert in web technologies.</p>
<p>Businesses and Organizations need my skills because I can do more for them in more ways than most. It's not an attitude of arrogance, but a confidence validated in my experience.</p>

<h2>The Army, Mental Health, and Support for Those in Need</h2>
<p>During my time in the infantry, I learned the hard way that I had a severe mental illness. I suffer from a severe depressive and anxiety disorder. This doesn't effect my work ethic, but it does effect my daily life.</p>
<p>My condition was severe enough that I was medically discharged from the Army, which often haunts me, as I was set on deployment to Afghanistan to fight the Taliban on their own soil. It left a would of survivor's guilt that I still struggle to manage.</p>
<p>Any veteran who has endured the hardships of combat training, daily fitness and toughness conditioning, and the constant waiting to go to war deserves the respect of everyone around them. Mental illness is the number one cause of veteran deaths in the US, often because they believe getting help shows weakness.</p>
<p>As a survivor of mental health who suffered in silence for years before taking the steps to heal, I understand the hardships that veterans and all others with mental health conditions edure.</p>
<p>Mental health disorders are the most overlooked conditions of any medical field. Many people approach those with mental health problems as "crazy."</p>
<p>I'm not crazy. People with mental health issues aren't crazy. They're suffering from chemical conditions in their brains that create immense challenges to function in daily life.</p>
<p>Like anyone with a medical disorder, those of us who suffer mentally need treatment and support. And we all need understanding of why we are the way we are.</p>
